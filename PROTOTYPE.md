## Project P3 Assigment 

### API description: 
The Yelp Fusion API provides local content and user reviews for millions of businesses (attractions, restaurants, etc.) for about 32 countries. Yelp API endpoints can be found at https://api.yelp.com/v3 followed by various paths for fields such as Business Search, Phone Search, Reviews, etc. The URL's of the restaurants point to the corresponding Yelp business page that a user might come across. 

### Search Criteria: 
As of now, we allow users of our application to search the API by providing a location (city, state, or country, for example).

### Summary Results: 
We are currently rendering the top 20 restaurant names for the given location. Over the next few weeks we plan to also render an image associated with the restaurant as well as ratings.

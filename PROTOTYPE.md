## Project P3 Assigment 

### API description: 
The Yelp Fusion API provides local content and user reviews for millions of businesses (attractions, restaurants, etc.) for about 32 countries. Yelp API endpoints can be found at https://api.yelp.com/v3 followed by various paths for fields such as Business Search, Phone Search, Reviews, etc. The URL's of the restaurants point to the corresponding Yelp business page that a user might come across. 

### Search Criteria: 
As of now, we allow users of our application to search the API by providing a location (city, state, or country, for example).

### Summary Results: 
We are currently rendering the top 20 restaurant names for the given location. We also render the restaurant's image, phone number, street address, city/state, rating, and price category associated with each restaurant. 

### Details Results: 
Under the details result page, we currently render the Address, Phone number, Rating, and Price for the restaurant that was clicked. We plan to add images and further details over the next few weeks as we build on the functionality.
